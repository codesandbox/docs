Create a sandbox to quickly prototype your ideas or work on a large codebase with CodeSandbox Projects: whatever your needs are we have you covered.

## Getting Started

### Installation

CodeSandbox for iOS is available for free on the App Store and you can get it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-js-javascript-ide/id1423330822).

### Authenticating with CodeSandbox

While you donâ€™t need a CodeSandbox account to use the app, the experience will be limited to developing offline sandboxes. The app combined with your CodeSandbox account will give you access to your sandboxes hosted on CodeSandbox, live collaboration and a huge range of sandbox templates to get you started. In addition, a CodeSandbox account is required to access Projects and develop projects of any size.

### Authenticating with github

To Authenticate a Sandbox with Github you'll need to open the Sandbox, tap the settings cog and scroll down to 'SSH Keys'. 

Generate the keys from within the Sandbox then go into Github, find your repo and add the public SSH key (at repo, not account level). 

Finally check the 'allow write access' box and you will be ready to go.

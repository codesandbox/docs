      ## Which languages and frameworks are supported?

[Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview) and [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview) work with anything that can run in Docker. They provide the best experience for JavaScript (including TypeScript), front-end and full-stack. We provide official templates (with built-in LSP/IntelliSense) for Rust, Go, Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Elixir, Node, Deno, and many more (more templates coming soon).

[Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/editor-features) are more limited. They support JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

[Create a Sandbox or Devbox from a template](https://codesandbox.io/new/), or read more
about the
[difference between Sandboxes and Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview#difference-between-devboxes--sandboxes).

## What operating systems and devices are supported?

CodeSandbox is designed for Desktop/Laptop operating systems, browsers and display resolutions.

Our editor may work on other operating systems and mobile devices. While we will take onboard feedback from users on these platforms, we do not officially support them or recommend them for the optimum CodeSandbox experience.

## How can I make a Sandbox private?

There are several ways to set a Sandbox as private. One universal way (that works both for Sandboxes and Devboxes) is to right-click a Sandbox from the dashboard and select _Make Sandbox private_.

You can also change the privacy settings from the editor. Click the _Share_ button on the top right and change the privacy drop-down at the top.

## When should I mark my Sandbox as "protected"?

Nobody outside your workspace can edit your Sandboxes; they can only fork it. However, in cases where you want to ensure that even workspace members cannot edit the Sandbox (which could be the case for finished projects), you can mark it as "protected" so it is not accidentally edited.

## I'm getting a 502 error "It looks like the dev server has not started yet", why?

Devbox [previews](/learn/devboxes/preview) are handled by a task that runs a dev server inside a CodeSandbox VM. Error `502` occurs when that task stops for some reason (some possible reasons being: task was stopped manually; application ran out of memory; the VM is not running). We automatically [hibernate VMs](/learn/environment/vm#memory-snapshotting) (including the preview) after 5 minutes of inactivity for Free users and 30 minutes of inactivity for Pro users, but when someone attempts to access either the code or the preview, we quickly resume the dev server (usually in under 2 seconds) — so "inactivity" is not a cause for the `502` error.

To troubleshoot this error, follow these steps:

- Open the Devbox on the CodeSandbox editor (if you only have access to the preview, forward these instructions to the Devbox author).
- Confirm that the [dev server task](/learn/devboxes/devtools#previews) is running; start/restart it as needed.
- Confirm that the preview tab on the right side of the editor doesn't show error `137` (which indicates that the Devbox ran out of memory).

If the problem persists after going through the checks above, please [submit a bug report](https://codesandbox.io/support#form)).

## My Devbox is running out of memory; what can I do?

You can increase the specs of the VM running your Devbox to get more memory. Follow these steps:

1. Click the CodeSandbox icon at the top left of the editor.
2. Click "Virtual Machine".
3. Under the "VM Specs" dropdown, pick a VM tier and then click "Apply" (if this option doesn't display, please ask a workspace admin to make this change).

<Callout>
Legacy CodeSandbox Pro plans cannot change VM specs; first, they must be [converted](https://codesandbox.io/upgrade) to our new "usage-based billing" Pro plan.
</Callout>

## I'm getting a CORS error when triggering a request to a Devbox URL, why?

The most common cause of this is your Devbox's privacy settings. Even when your Devbox is private, we still need a preview token to access the preview URLs. Currently, we do not support private Devboxes with public previews. Changing the Devbox privacy to 'Unlisted' often fixes this issue.

## Why are my start scripts not having an effect?

For performance reasons, we ignore any specified scripts in Sandboxes and use a default script instead. If you need to control the scripts, then we
recommend using a [Devbox](/learn/devboxes/overview).

## I'm getting a 422 error when importing from GitHub, why?

There are a few possible reasons a repo might throw that error on import. The
most common are: the lack of a `package.json` file, or the project using
more than 500 modules (files).

If you think it's something else, or you're unable to solve this yourself, then [get in touch using our support form](https://codesandbox.io/support#form)
and provide a link to the repo you're importing and we can look into this for
you.

## Can I change the Node version used in a Devbox?

Yes, we have instructions on the [VM configuration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/vm#configuring-nodejs-version) page that explain how to change the Node version. All recent server Sandboxes run in a Devbox.

## How can I change the editor's theme?

To change the theme, click on the CodeSandbox icon at the top left of the editor, then go to Editor > Color Theme, and select a theme from the Themes dropdown. You can also do it from the [command palette](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/commandpalette) by picking the option "Preferences: Color Theme".

## Do Sandboxes have any limitations?

We currently provide [Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/editor-features) and [Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview). Sandboxes have the following limitations:

- Can only run front-end JavaScript or TypeScript projects (servers not supported).
- Imported Sandboxes must contain a `package.json` file.
- Lower file upload sizes, which are handled per account (as explained on the [File Upload page](/learn/devboxes/upload#upload-limits)).
- Cannot use more than 500 modules (files). Note that
  `node_modules` and dependencies do not count toward this limit.

Devboxes are part of our evolved CodeSandbox experience, so we highly advise you to use them to avoid encountering these limitations.

## I'm getting a 'Request Entity too Large' error, what should I do?

If you encounter this error when importing or committing, check your Sandbox or
repo for large binary files and remove them.

## Which CodeSandbox domains should I whitelist on my firewall to ensure CodeSandbox loads correctly?

If you suspect that your Sandboxes/Devboxes aren't starting due to your firewall rules, try whitelisting the following domains:

- `codesandbox.io`
- `*.csb.app`
- `worker.codesandbox.io`

## Can I use a database on CodeSandbox?

Yes, you can use any database that has a Docker image available with a Devbox. Some popular databases with Docker images include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

{/* For ready-to-use examples, check our [Devbox](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/recent?create=true) templates. */}

### Do I need to install Docker on my local machine to use it in CodeSandbox?

No, you don't need to install Docker on your local machine. CodeSandbox has [built-in support for Docker](https://codesandbox.io/blog/introducing-docker-support-in-codesandbox), so you can use it directly in the online development environment.

### How can I access the database once it's running in a Docker container?

You can access the database using the appropriate driver for your language or framework. Typically, you'll need to provide the hostname, port number, username, and password to connect to the database. If you want to connect locally to the database, you can use our VS Code integration to open the Devbox inside VS Code, and then forward the port of the database to localhost.

### Can I use multiple databases in the same CodeSandbox project?

Yes, you can use multiple databases in the same project by running multiple Docker containers with different port numbers.

### Can I use Docker Compose in CodeSandbox?

Yes, you can use Docker Compose in CodeSandbox to orchestrate multiple containers and define the relationships between them. However, you'll need to create a Docker Compose file and run the `docker-compose` command in the terminal to start the containers. We share more about this [in our Docker tutorial](https://codesandbox.io/docs/tutorial/getting-started-with-docker#4-create-docker-compose-file).

### Is it safe to use a database in CodeSandbox with Docker support?

Yes, it's safe to use a database in CodeSandbox with Docker support, as long as you follow best practices for security and keep your database credentials private. Docker provides a secure and isolated environment for running containers, so your database is protected from external threats. We also prevent any connections to your Devbox without sign in if your Devbox is private.

### How can I troubleshoot issues with my database in CodeSandbox with Docker support?

If you're having issues with your database, you can check the container logs to see if there are any error messages. You can also run commands like `docker ps` and `docker logs` in the terminal to get more information about the container. Additionally, you can ask for help on the CodeSandbox community forums or consult the documentation of the specific database you're using.

## Can I push/pull from a GitLab, Azure DevOps, or BitBucket repository?

Yes. While our Repositories only have built-in push and sync capabilities for GitHub, you can connect to a remote repository from any other git provider.

To do that, use our terminal to `git remote add` the remote repository and then add your credentials for it. You can also add the authentication details to the CodeSandbox microVM using [environment variables](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/secrets).

       ## What to do about that recurring trust modal?

![Trust Modal](./learn/images/vscode-trust.jpg)

This modal shows up every time you launch a project folder in a new container. Since every branch will be opened with a unique SSH URL, VS Code will ask you to verify that you trust the connection. This is an important security notice to ensure that the user understands the connection being established before opening the code. You can read more about the modal on the [VS Code blog](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/07/06/workspace-trust).

## Do I have to be connected to a live session on CodeSandbox to work on a branch?

It is possible to work in an “un-synced” state. For CodeSandbox features to work, the branch needs to be established on a remote connection **and** connected to Pitcher (learn [how it works](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-vscode#how-it-works)).

## Who can access my code?

Only people on your CodeSandbox team with permissions to the repository may join as collaborators. Repository permissions are carried over from GitHub.

To add someone new to the team, provide access on GitHub and add them to your CodeSandbox team. From there, they can access the code in the browser or follow the steps above to use VS Code.

## Is it possible to use GitHub Copilot together with CodeSandbox?

Yes. Follow the steps below:

1. Use our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects) to connect to one of our Devboxes or Repositories.
2. Install the Copilot VS Code extension (if not already installed).
3. Configure the extension to run in CodeSandbox remote connections (following the instructions for [Default User Extensions](/learn/repositories/editors#default-user-extensions)).

### What is the current state of CodeSandbox for iOS?

CodeSandbox for iOS is no longer available.

CodeSandbox is currently unable to maintain the app experience and has removed it from the App Store. This does not remove the app from your device or prevent you from opening it if you already have it installed.

      ## Sandboxes

### Why am I getting a git error resolving a dependency?

CodeSandbox for iOS is only compatible with dependencies hosted and accessible via HTTP or HTTPS.

This happens because the app doesn't provide local shell environments where you can run arbitrary commands, like git. Use the [CodeSandbox web editor](/learn/sandboxes/editors) instead.

You may find some of the following answers helpful if you have gone through the sections in this documentation but still haven’t solved your questions:

### I'm getting an error trying to run my Sandbox in CodeSandbox for iOS. What could be the cause?

The root cause of the problem could be either a coding mistake on your side or a dependency trying to do something forbidden by iOS.

For instance, dependencies relying on WebAssembly won't work, as WebAssembly requires JIT compilation to function, and this isn't allowed by the App Store guidelines.

Another cause can be that your project or one of its dependencies rely on a native dependency or Node extension, which aren’t supported.

### One of the scripts in my Sandbox cannot be run. What could be the cause?

Only the scripts that start with `node` or the name of a dependency located inside the `node_modules/.bin` directory are compatible. This happens because CodeSandbox for iOS doesn’t provide a shell environment, so scripts containing an arbitrary bash command won't work.

### I can't see the preview of my Sandbox in the web browser. What could be the cause?

The runtime provides a `WEB_PORT` environment variable matching the port used by default by the in-app web browser. If your Sandbox doesn't use the port in that environment variable, then you will need to fix the URL in the web browser to load the page on the right port.

### Why does my Sandbox stop running when I move the app to the background?

This happens because iOS suspends the process while the application is in the background, which also suspends all its activity.

### My Sandbox requires Node.js 14 but the app uses Node.js 12. How can I change the Node.js version?

The application uses a Node.js port that hasn’t been upgraded to Node.js 14 as we have been focused on integrating the new CodeSandbox experience instead. Stay tuned, as we will be making some updates.

## Repositories

### Why can't I make any changes to my project?

You likely have a protected branch selected (i.e. `main`). Forking a branch will create a new one where you can make changes.

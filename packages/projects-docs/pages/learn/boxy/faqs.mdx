# Boxy FAQs

### How does Boxy differ from ChatGPT?

Although Boxy is built using GPT at its core, one key distinguishing factor is that Boxy is aware of the code in your sandbox or repository. As a result, Boxy's suggestions will consider existing patterns in your project's code.

### How do I get access to Boxy?

Boxy and all CodeSandbox AI-powered tools are available to Pro workspaces. You can [upgrade](https://codesandbox.io/pro) or [start a free trial](https://codesandbox.io/pro?team) to experience development with Boxy.

### Is Boxy available in all CodeSandbox plans?

No. Boxy is only available to [Pro subscribers](https://codesandbox.io/pro).

### Is Boxy available for browser sandboxes?

No. Boxy is exclusively available in cloud sandboxes and repositories. However, you can easily [fork a browser sandbox into a cloud sandbox](/tutorial/convert-browser-sandbox-cloud) to get access to Boxy. This is available through the "sparkles" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar, as seen below.

# CodeSandbox Devboxes

CodeSandbox provides two development environments that are ideal for prototyping and rapid web development: [Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview) (which run in a virtual machine (VM)) and [Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/templates) (which run using browser resources).

We generally recommend using Devboxes, which provide all the tooling needed for building prototypes. Sandboxes are mostly useful as a playground for basic front-end JavaScript projects.

Previously known as Cloud Sandboxes, Devboxes are a great way to work on any type of project, regardless of its language or size. Devboxes run [VMs](/learn/environment/vm) and leverage our memory snapshotting to spin up an environment in 1.5 seconds. They have built-in [Docker support](/learn/environment/docker) and include several valuable features, such as [AI](/learn/ai/overview), collaborative [Terminals](/learn/repositories/terminal), [Tasks](/learn/repositories/task), and [VS Code integration](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-vscode).

Devboxes are built for scale. Our Free plan includes generous VM specs but you can easily [start a Pro trial](https://codesandbox.io/pro) to improve them.

## Creating a Devbox
To create a new Devbox, you can clone a template from our ["Create Devbox"](https://codesandbox.io/d) modal. When clicking on a template, we create a fork (a copy) of the template and open the newly created sandbox in our web editor.

## Difference between Devboxes & Sandboxes

## What is a Devbox?
Unlike Sandboxes that run on your browser, Devboxes run on our [VMs](/learn/environment/vm).

       Devboxes are great for prototyping any type of project in any programming language. They can run both backend and front-end services.
       You can learn more about the editor and the unique functionalities of the cloud developer environment in [repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

       Like Sandboxes, Devboxes are free to use.

       Devboxes run on VMs, which brings two features that make them great for prototyping:

       1. Fast cloning. You can fork Devbox [within 2 seconds](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds) and continue with an exact clone of the microVM. This way, you can quickly test multiple approaches to your prototype.
       2. Instant resume. When you connect to a Devbox, it will wake up within 1 second and continue with your running dev server. This way, you can quickly continue prototyping.

       Devboxes and Repositories branches run on the same infrastructure and use the same editor. The main distinction is that Repositories have more features suited to full-scale development. Once you create a Repository from a Devbox you will have:
       - Branching
       - Git tooling
       - Full integration with GitHub

       To configure a Devbox, you can read more about [tasks](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/task) and [Docker](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/docker).

    ## What is a Sandbox?
      When using Sandboxes, your code is evaluated and run in our built-in
execution environment. These client environments run entirely inside of your browser and will continue to
bundle your code even when you lose your connection to our servers.

Sandboxes each have their own bundler attached to them which is
configured to support a specific framework and emulate their official CLI tools.
They are not one-to-one implementations and thus do not support advanced
configuration like custom webpack configurations or ejecting. However, they are
designed to mirror the default behavior of the framework.

If your project requires the use of a terminal or any additional advanced configuration like Docker, you can use a [Devbox](/learn/sandboxes/overview?tab=cloud) instead.

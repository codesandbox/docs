# CodeSandbox Devboxes

CodeSandbox provides two development environments that are ideal for prototyping and rapid web development: [Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview) (which run in a virtual machine (VM)) and [Sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/templates) (which run using browser resources).

We generally recommend using Devboxes, which provide all the tooling needed for building prototypes. Sandboxes are mostly useful as a playground for basic front-end JavaScript projects.

Previously known as Cloud Sandboxes, Devboxes are a great way to work on any type of project, regardless of its language or size. Devboxes run [VMs](/learn/environment/vm) and leverage our memory snapshotting to spin up an environment in 1.5 seconds. They have built-in [Docker support](/learn/environment/docker) and include several valuable features, such as [AI](/learn/ai/overview), collaborative [Terminals](/learn/repositories/terminal), [Tasks](/learn/repositories/task), and [VS Code integration](/learn/getting-started/setting-up-vscode).

## What is a Devbox?

Unlike Sandboxes that run on your browser, Devboxes run on our [VMs](/learn/environment/vm).

       Devboxes are great for building any type of project in any programming language. They can run both backend and front-end services.
       You can learn more about the editor and the unique functionalities of the cloud developer environment in [repositories](/learn/repositories/overview).

       Like Sandboxes, Devboxes are free to use.

       Devboxes run on VMs, which brings two features that make them great for prototyping:

       1. Fast cloning. You can fork Devbox [within 2 seconds](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds) and continue with an exact clone of the microVM. This way, you can quickly test multiple approaches to your prototype.
       2. Instant resume. When you connect to a Devbox, it will wake up within 1 second and continue with your running dev server. This way, you can quickly continue prototyping.

       Devboxes and Repositories branches run on the same infrastructure and use the same editor. The main distinction is that Repositories have more features suited to full-scale development. Once you create a Repository from a Devbox you will have:
       - Branching
       - Git tooling
       - Full integration with GitHub

       To configure a Devbox, you can read more about [tasks](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/task) and [Docker](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/docker).

## Creating a Devbox

To create a new Devbox, you can clone a template from our ["Create Devbox"](https://codesandbox.io/d) modal. When clicking on a template, we create a fork (a copy) of the template and open the newly created sandbox in our web editor.

# Setting up iOS

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
The CodeSandbox for iOS app is currently not supported.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

Bring your CodeSandbox projects with you wherever you go with just your iPhone or iPad. First, download the CodeSandbox app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/codesandbox/id1423330822) and log in using your CodeSandbox account. If you don't have one, you can quickly sign up using a GitHub, Google, or Apple account.

> 💡 For the full CodeSandbox experience, we recommend linking your GitHub account. This will allow you to import your GitHub repositories and contribute to them faster.

### Select the Appropriate Workspace

When you log in, your personal workspace will be selected as the default. If you're part of a team, you can easily switch to your team's workspace by selecting it from the sidebar.

On an iPhone, you can access the screen to switch workspaces by tapping the **Back** button in the screen's top left corner.

### Accessing Sandboxes and Repositories

If you are an existing CodeSandbox user, you will see a list of sandboxes and repositories you have recently interacted with under the **Recent** section after selecting a workspace.

To view all available sandboxes and repositories, navigate through the different categories in the sidebar, such as **Repositories** and **Sandboxes** or use the **Search** functionality, which is available at the top of the screen.

### Creating a New Sandbox or Repository

You can start coding by using one of the existing CodeSandbox templates or by importing a repository from GitHub.

#### Creating a Sandbox from a Template

Start coding in seconds by using one of the official CodeSandbox templates. It's a quick and easy way to get started with any technology without any setup required.

You can do this from the **New Sandbox** screen available in the **Recent** and **Sandboxes** sections.

#### Importing a Repository from GitHub

To start importing a repository from GitHub, tap the **New Repository** button. You will be prompted to link your CodeSandbox account with a GitHub account if you haven't already.

In the import screen, you can either enter the link to the GitHub repository you want to import or select a repository from one of the GitHub organizations you belong to, including your personal GitHub organization.

CodeSandbox will automatically create a fork in GitHub for repositories to which you don't have write permissions.

### Working with Local Sandboxes

With CodeSandbox for iOS, you can also create small Node.js prototypes locally. This is a useful feature when you're developing on your iOS device and don't have internet access. However, the functionality of these local sandboxes is limited due to restrictions imposed by the iOS operating system on applications available from the App Store.

For instance, local sandboxes are restricted to Node.js version 12, and any framework that relies on JIT compilation or WebAssembly won't work. In this case, we suggest you use CodeSandbox Devboxes if possible.

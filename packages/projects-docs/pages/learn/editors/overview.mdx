Any project running in a Devbox may also be run in VS Code. Work from your local environment with your own configurations and shortcuts whilst remaining connected to the CodeSandbox development environment.

**Install the CodeSandbox VS Code extension and open any branch or Devbox directly in your VS Code editor.**

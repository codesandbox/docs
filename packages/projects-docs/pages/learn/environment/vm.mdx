# Environment

CodeSandbox Repositories and Cloud Sandboxes run on [microVM technology](https://codesandbox.io/blog/how-we-clone-a-running-vm-in-2-seconds). Each branch and cloud sandbox gets its own microVM and their resources (shown below) are set to each one of these instances.

## Default resources

Based on our analysis of usual resource needs, we have defined these resources as default:

| Type    | Limit   |
| ------- | ------- |
| CPU     | 2 vCPUs |
| Memory  | 2Gi     |
| Storage | 6Gi     |

But we can go higher, up to 12vCPUs, 16GB memory and 30GB storage. To upgrade to higher specs, you can ugrade to one of our [Pro plans](https://codesandbox.io/pro).

If you require specs that go beyond our Pro plan defaults, [get in touch](mailto:support@codesandbox.io) and our team will adjust the limits to suit your project.

## Persistence

Everything you save in `/project` is guaranteed to be persisted between reboots, hibernations and forks. Every file change outside of `/project` will usually be persisted, but there is a chance that those changes will be cleared.

Your project folder lives in `/project/<repo-name>`, your home folder lives in `/project/home/<username>`. Your home folder is inaccessible for other users.

If your branch has not been accessed for 31 days, we delete the contents of `/project`. This means that the next time you start this branch again, we will reinitialize `/project` by doing a fresh clone.

For any uncommitted work we make a backup. This backup is never deleted. All your uncommitted work is restored when you open a branch where the `/project` folder is deleted. This means that you will never lose your work, even if we delete `/project` after 31 days of inactivity.

Memory snapshots (which allow instant resume of VMs) will be cleaned up after 7 to 31 days of inactivity. There is no lost work from cleaning up memory snapshots.

## Node Modules

The `node_modules` folder is globally ignored. You can override this behaviour by adding `!node_modules` in your own project `.gitignore` file. While this will add `node_modules` folders to git, they won't be displayed in the UI.

## Environment configuration

You can configure the environment of your VM with a `Dockerfile`. To do this, create a file in the `.codesandbox` folder called `Dockerfile`. After you've saved the file, you should be prompted with a notification to restart the container.

### Configuring NodeJS version

For example, to update NodeJS to v18, you can create a `.codesandbox/Dockerfile` with these contents:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
```

### Deno support

If we detect a `deno.json` file in your sandbox or repository during boot, we'll automatically enable the Deno LSP (which provides autocompletions) instead of the TypeScript LSP. You can also force this by creating a file called `.codesandbox/features.json` and inserting these contents:

```json
{
    "deno": true
}
```

### Vue support

Vue also has a custom LSP to handle TypeScript files better. If we detect any `.vue` files in the project, we'll default to using that LSP. You can also forcefully enable or disable this by creating a `.codesandbox/features.json` file and inserting these contents:

```json
{
    "vue": {
        // Whether to enable Vue LSP for TS files
        takeOverMode: true,
        // Whether to enable component inspector functionality in the editor for Vue
        inspector: true,
    }
}
```

## Docker support

CodeSandbox supports running Docker containers inside any workspace. You can learn more about our Docker support in our [Docker documentation](/learn/environment/docker).

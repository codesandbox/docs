# Discover Page

CodeSandbox features a [Discover page](https://codesandbox.io/discover). This page highlights some of the interesting Sandboxes and Devboxes created by members of the CodeSandbox community.

It also includes a powerful search option, which allows you to find all the public Sandboxes created by other CodeSandbox users.

## Which Sandboxes get picked?

The CodeSandbox team picks Sandboxes based on their content and/or appearance. This includes those with interesting logic or approach and those that just look cool.

## How can I get picked?

We review Sandboxes submitted to us by users via email, but the best way to get our attention is to tweet about it and tag [@codesandbox](https://x.com/codesandbox).

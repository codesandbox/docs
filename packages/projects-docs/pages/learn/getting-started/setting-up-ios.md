# Setting up iOS

## Getting Started

You can start using CodeSandbox from the web, VS Code, or even iOS - so you can choose the [most convenient platform](/learn/sandboxes/editors) that fits your workflow. Furthermore, you can easily switch between different clients whenever you want and continue the work on your project where you left off.

## Importing a project

Once you have signed into CodeSandbox with your GitHub account, you can import your first project. 

You can easily import any public repositories by pasting its GitHub URL into the “GitHub repository URL” field and hitting the “enter” key or the “Import button”. This action will automatically fork the repository and spin a development environment for you to start coding straight away.

In addition, you can create a project from any repository (public or private if you are a Pro user) of any GitHub Organization you belong to or create a new project using one of the templates available.

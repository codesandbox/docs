CodeSandbox provides instant cloud development environments that keep you in flow.

Our microVM infrastructure makes it easy for you to spin up a development environment in the cloud and start working on it, whether it's a small prototype or a big monolith with multiple services.

To use CodeSandbox for cloud development with a strong GitHub integration, we recommend using [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview). If you want to prototype an idea or create a demo, we recommend using [Devboxes](/learn/devboxes/overview).

## Editors

We provide many alternatives for you to code. Each option is built to help you focus on what matters: getting the work done without friction.

## Unified Platform Editor

In November 2023 we launched the latest version of our web editor. Leveraging the power of VSCode, our new editor offers a seamless experience whether you're coding a basic front end demonstration in a [Sandbox](/learn/devboxes/editors?tab=sandbox) or building a full stack prototype in a [Devbox](/learn/devboxes/editors?tab=devbox).
While there are some feature differences between the two environments. The Editor experience and layout is consistent on CodeSandbox, regardless of your start point. You can also easily convert Sandboxes to Devboxes when you're ready to take any of your projects to the next level. 

## V1 Sandbox Editor

Known and loved for years, our original editor was built for rapid web development using only the power of the browser. All the features from this editor are gradually being added to the Unified Platfrom Editor. However, the browser editor remains available to everyone who still calls it home.

The V1 Editor only works with Browser Sandboxes. You can opt out of the Unified Platform (Beta) editor in your [Experiments Settings](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/recent?preferences=experiments)

## Easily move between web and VS Code

Any project running in a cloud web editor may also be run in VS Code. Work from your local environment with your own configurations and shortcuts whilst remaining connected to the CodeSandbox development environment.

**Install the CodeSandbox VS Code extension and open any branch or Devbox directly in your VS Code editor.**

## Opening a branch in VS Code

![Open in vscode button](./images/getting-openvscode.jpg)

To start working on a branch on VS Code, open the branch in the Editor and click on the `Open in VS Code` button positioned in the bottom left corner. This will prompt you to install the CodeSandbox extension responsible for making the connection to our cloud development environment.

To get the most from your local setup, check our [VS Code Extension documentation](/learn/editors/vscode/overview).

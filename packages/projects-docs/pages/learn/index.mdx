hello!!!

CodeSandbox provides instant cloud development environments that keep you in flow.

Our microVM infrastructure makes it easy for you to spin up a development environment in the cloud and start working on it, whether it's a small prototype or a big monolith with multiple services.

To use CodeSandbox for cloud development with a strong GitHub integration, we recommend using [repositories](/learn/repositories/overview). If you want to prototype an idea or create a demo, we recommend using [sandboxes](/learn/sandboxes/overview).

## Editors

We provide many alternatives for you to code. Each option is built to help you focus on what matters: getting the work done without friction.

## Cloud Web Editor

Introduced in 2022, the cloud web editor leverages the power of micro virtual machines (microVMs) to run projects of any type and size. We recommend it as the first choice for daily development, reviewing code or quickly spinning up prototypes.

## Browser Sandbox Editor

Known and loved for years, this editor was built for rapid web development using only the power of the browser. All the features from this editor are gradually being added to the cloud editor. However, the browser editor remains available to everyone who still calls it home.

## Easily move between web and VS Code

Any project running in a cloud web editor may also be run in VS Code. Work from your local environment with your own configurations and shortcuts whilst remaining connected to the CodeSandbox development environment.

**Install the CodeSandbox Projects VS Code extension and open any branch or cloud sandbox directly in your VS Code editor.**

## Opening a branch in VS Code

To start working on a branch on VS Code, open the branch in the Editor and click on the `Open in VS Code` button positioned in the bottom left corner. This will prompt you to install the CodeSandbox extension responsible for making the connection to our cloud development environment.

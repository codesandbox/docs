# Explore Page & Curators

## Explore Page

CodeSandbox features an [explore page](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/discover). This page highlights some of
the interesting sandboxes created an curated by members of the CodeSandbox
community.

## What is a curator?

A curator is someone in the community who can pick sandboxes for the explore
page. You can get an invitation to become a "curator" from staff or other
curators. Everyone is applicable to become a curator, but we generally select
people that are active on CodeSandbox or are knowledgeable in a specific field
(eg. animations).

If you're interested in becoming a curator, send us an e-mail at
[mailto:curators@codesandbox.io](mailto:curators@codesandbox.io).

## Which sandboxes get picked?

Sandboxes get picked based on their content and/or appearance. This includes
those with interesting logic or approach. As well as those that just look cool.

## How can I get picked?

We have a dashboard with popular sandboxes to pick from, but we also pick based
on what we happen to see. We scour Twitter for sandboxes too, if you want to be
picked we recommend you to mention us in a tweet
[@codesandbox](https://twitter.com/codesandbox) with a link to your sandbox!

# CodeSandbox Friends

At CodeSandbox, we believe in the power of open source and benefit from diverse contributions made by individuals to the global developer community. In return, we offer free or low-cost access to CodeSandbox for eligible projects as part of the CodeSandbox Friends program. We're also here to support non-profits making a positive impact in the world.

Thank you for being part of our community!

## Who qualifies?

To qualify for the CodeSandbox Friends program, a project must fall into one of the following categories.

- **Licensed open-source software**: Libraries, frameworks, and plugins that developers use to build applications. CodeSandbox may be used to develop and share documentation examples or to publish NPM packages for consumption by the community. Projects in this category must be publicly available with a valid Open Source license&ast;.
- **Developer community projects**: Projects that offer tools, content and other resources for free to the developer community. This includes educational projects&ast;&ast; and resources that help people learn how to code.    
- **Non-profit organizations**: Legally-recognized non-profit and non-governmental organizations that use CodeSandbox to further their mission and improve the lives of the people they serve.

_&ast;Open-Source projects that are backed by for-profit organizations are unfortunately not eligible for CodeSandbox Friends. However, we may be able to offer a discounted <a href="https://codesandbox.io/enterprise">CodeSandbox Enterprise</a> plan._

_&ast;&ast;Educational courses or projects that require payment or that are part of a for-profit organization's offering (such as a fee-charging University) are not eligible for CodeSandbox Friends. We offer a custom plan for legally recognized education organizations. Please <a href="mailto:sales@codesandbox.io">contact us</a> for further information._

## Application Requirements

# CodeSandbox Friends

At CodeSandbox, we believe in the power of open source and benefit from diverse contributions made by individuals to the global developer community. In return, we offer free or low-cost access to CodeSandbox for eligible projects as part of the CodeSandbox Friends program. We're also here to support non-profits making a positive impact in the world.

Thank you for being part of our community!

## Who qualifies?

To qualify for the CodeSandbox Friends program, a project must fall into one of the following categories.

- **Licensed open-source software**: Libraries, frameworks, and plugins that developers use to build applications. CodeSandbox may be used to develop and share documentation examples or to publish NPM packages for consumption by the community. Projects in this category must be publicly available with a valid Open Source license&ast;.
- **Developer community projects**: Projects that offer tools, content and other resources for free to the developer community. This includes educational projects&ast;&ast; and resources that help people learn how to code.
- **Non-profit organizations**: Legally recognized non-profit and non-governmental organizations that use CodeSandbox to further their mission and improve the lives of the people they serve.

_&ast;Open-source projects that are backed by for-profit organizations are unfortunately not eligible for CodeSandbox Friends. However, we may be able to offer a discounted <a href="https://codesandbox.io/enterprise">CodeSandbox Enterprise</a> plan._

_&ast;&ast;Educational courses or projects that require payment or that are part of a for-profit organization's offering (such as a fee-charging University) are not eligible for CodeSandbox Friends. We offer [education plans](/learn/plans/education-plans) specifically catered to students and educators who fit these parameters.

## Application Requirements
- Projects that are backed or owned by for-profit companies, even if open-source, are not eligible for CodeSandbox Friends.
- Applicants need to be the owner of the Project/Repository. Owners can invite contributors to the Friends workspace when their application is approved.
- Applicants need to apply once per 'CodeSandbox Friends' project. Any applications linking multiple projects will automatically be rejected.
- Applicants must explain how their project would benefit from a CodeSandbox Friends Workspace. Only applications that include this explanation will be accepted.
- If your project is no longer actively maintained but otherwise fits our eligibility, we can offer a custom Sandbox limit to support uses of CodeSandbox in documentation/educational guides. **Please include the required number of sandboxes in your application.**

## Benefits and Discounts

All CodeSandbox workspaces that are approved as CodeSandbox Friends receive the following benefits:

- Unlimited number of Sandboxes on the eligible workspace.
- Special access to upcoming updates to our Sandbox API.

# CodeSandbox Friends

At CodeSandbox, we believe in the power of open source and benefit from diverse contributions made by individuals to the global developer community. In return, we offer free or low-cost access to CodeSandbox for eligible projects as part of the CodeSandbox Friends program. We're also here to support non-profits making a positive impact in the world.

Thank you for being part of our community!

## Who qualifies?

To qualify for the CodeSandbox Friends program, a project must fall into one of the following categories.

- **Licensed open-source software**: Libraries, frameworks, and plugins that developers use to build applications. CodeSandbox may be used to develop and share documentation examples or to publish NPM packages for consumption by the community. Projects in this category must be publicly available with a valid Open Source license.
- **Developer community projects**: Projects that offer tools, content and other resources for free to the developer community. This includes educational projects and resources that help people learn how to code.    
- **Non-profit organizations**: Legally-recognized non-profit and non-governmental organizations that use CodeSandbox to further their mission and improve the lives of the people they serve.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for a CodeSandbox Friends discount, a project must satisfy the following criteria:

**Non-commercial**: The project cannot be used to promote a product or service; it has to provide something of value to the community at no cost. Applications for non-commercial projects backed by commercial entities will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

**Publicly available**: The project must be publicly usable and, if applicable, include documentation or instructions on how the community can use it. The project must have verifiable adoption and clones of open-source projects will be denied access. We will review recent code commits and project activity to determine that the project is actively being developed and accessible to the community.

## Benefits and Discounts

All CodeSandbox workspaces that are approved as CodeSandbox Friends receive the following benefits:

- Unlimited number of Sandboxes on the eligible workspace.
- Special access to upcoming updates to our Sandbox API.

# CodeSandbox Education Plans

One of the core values of CodeSandbox is empowerment: enabling creators to feel like they can build without limits.

Our education plans allow us to support those learning to code and those empowering the next generation of developers. These plans include special discounts for access to CodeSandbox Pro, as described below. 

## Discounts for Students

Verified student accounts are eligible for a discount of 25% off on [CodeSandbox Pro](https://codesandbox.io/pricing), which applies both to the base plan and [on-demand credits](/learn/credit-usage/credits#on-demand-credits).

To apply and claim the discount code, <a href="mailto:friends@codesandbox.io">contact us</a> from your valid student email address.

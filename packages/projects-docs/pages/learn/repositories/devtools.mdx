# DevTools
 
![CodeSandbox Preview](../images/devtools-open.jpg)

Devtools are tools for developers to work faster and more efficiently. They are useful for debugging, testing, and developing. They are collaborative by default, allowing you to share their content: a terminal output, a preview error, a console log...

Add as many devtools as you want. For one or two devtools, the layout will adapt to the viewport; more than three items will create a scroll. 


## Start a Devtool

You can add a Devtool by clicking on the `+` button on the header or by pressing <kbd>Cmd/Clt</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> to open the DevTool menu.



## Manage your DevTool

#### Minimize

Minimize the Devtool by clicking on the `...` icon in the top left corner and selecting the option `Minimize`. A minimized view is useful when you have limited viewport space and would like to still track some processes. 

#### Close 

Close the Devtool by clicking on the `...` in the top left corner and selecting the option `Close`. You can also close all devtools through the command palette (<kbd>Cmd/Clt</kbd> <kbd>K</kbd>) by typing `close all devtools`.

<Callout emoji="→">
Closing a devtool will not stop it, it will keep running in the background. If you want to stop the process, you must select the option `Close and stop`.

#### Reorder

Drag and drop to reorder the Devtools, or click on the `...` button in the top right corner, then choose `Move up` or `Move down`.

#### Configure

You can control the name, position and what Devtools to run when you open the Web Editor. Check the [`tasks.json`](./task) documentation for more information on how to configure the Devtools.

Setting up the Devtools makes it easier for non-developers to access and run your project.

## Available DevTools


- **[Preview](./preview)**
- **[Task](./task)**
- **[Terminal](./terminal)**

We are working on supporting other DevTools in the future, which may include:

- Test runner UI
- Viewing / editing [Design Tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) in a project
- Viewing components in isolation and changing their props from a UI
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) integration
- Bundle size analyzer

# Git Workflow

## Git panel

After you have made some changes to your code and saved them (<kbd>‚åò + S or Ctrl + S</kbd>), you will notice a purple notification next to the git icon at the top of the left sidebar.

Clicking that icon or using <kbd>‚åÉ ‚áß G or Ctrl + ‚áß + G</kbd> reveals the Git panel, which will contain a list of your previous commits, as well as all uncommitted changes.

## Committing changes

Under the "Uncomitted changes" section, you will find a text field where you can input a commit message. If you have the [Boxy AI assistant](/learn/boxy/overview) enabled, Boxy will automatically suggest a commit message based on the changes you made. Optionally, you can click the sparkles icon at the top right of the text box to generate a new commit message using Boxy.

Finally, when you click the "Commit and push" button, we commit the changes to the branch on GitHub.

<Callout emoji="üí°">You can also commit changes using the terminal. This is especially useful is you're working with a repository from GitLab or another non-GitHub git provider, as our git panel currently only supports GitHub repos.</Callout>

## Opening a pull request

When you're ready to open a PR, you can either click ‚ÄúCreate PR‚Äù at the top right of the web editor or commit from the Git panel in the sidebar.



<Callout emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">New branches are not automatically created on GitHub. We only push the branch to GitHub when you create a commit or rename the branch.</Callout>

Next, let's do some configuration to make your repository work in CodeSandbox.

## Using the git panel

CodeSandbox has an opinionated flow when it comes to working with repositories, and you can see hints of this in the editor.

As soon as you enter the editor, you will see the current branch name in the header. Every branch has its own VM and is available through a unique URL. For example, if two people visit the URL for the `main` branch, they will be able to see each other's cursor, terminals and DevTools.

<Callout emoji="üí°">URLs for branches are predictable. So, if you want to open a specific branch, you can update the URL with the new branch name, and we'll import & create an environment for that branch automatically.</Callout>

On CodeSandbox, the `main` branch is protected by default. This means that it's read-only and will sync automatically with the branch on GitHub when new commits come in.

To write some code, you have three options:
1. (Recommended) Just start typing some code - we will create a new branch for you using seamless branching!
2. Click the ‚ÄúBranch‚Äù button in the header.
3. [Toggle protection off](/learn/environment/branch-protection) for the `main` branch.

When we create the new branch, we create a clone of the `main` VM and switch it to the new branch. This new VM is an _exact_ copy of the original VM, down to the memory contents. Because of this, processes like dev servers are already started in the cloned VM.

<Callout emoji="üí°">Tip: you can start a Postgres database on the `main` branch, seed some data in it, and then every new branch created from `main` will have that data available.</Callout>

# Drafts
Workspace members have access to a personal Sandbox drafts section in every workspace to which they belong. Drafts are intended to provide a private space to test ideas before sharing them with the workspace.

All drafts are private and only editable by their creator. Once a draft is moved out of the drafts folder, it becomes editable by anyone in the workspace. 

## Subscriptions and limits
Members of Free workspaces can create up to 10 Sandbox drafts, while in Pro workspaces, every workspace member has access to an unlimited number.

**Note**:
If you had more than 10 drafts in the drafts folder when the draft restrictions were put in place, all old drafts would be marked as `restricted`, meaning that they are `read-only` until their owner updates their privacy. 
This ensures that any Sandboxes that have been shared via embeds do not break until the owner has time to move the Sandbox to a workspace folder where sharing is encouraged.

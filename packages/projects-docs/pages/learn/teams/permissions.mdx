# User Permissions

### Users with write access

Users with write access to a repository can enjoy the full feature set available on CodeSandbox Repositories.

### Users with read-only access 

Users with read-only access to the repository can browse the content of the project, check the previews and even execute a few tasks. To introduce changes, they need to create a contribution branch or fork the repository. For more information, visit the [open source collaboration](/learn/getting-started/open-source) page.

### Anonymous users

Users without a CodeSandbox Account can only browse the content of the project and interact with the previews.

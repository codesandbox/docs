# Synced Templates

## What are synced templates?

Synced templates are [templates](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/vm-sandboxes/templates) that are created from a GitHub repository, or a folder in a GitHub repository. A synced template stays in sync with its source, so when you create a commit in the GitHub repository, the template will automatically update with the new contents on the next access.

  Because synced templates stay in sync with their source, you can't edit a synced template in CodeSandbox. If you want to edit the template, you must commit to the source repository. You could consider that GitHub is the "owner" of the template.

### How is a synced template different from CodeSandbox Repositories?

CodeSandbox also has [Repositories](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/overview), which are also imported from GitHub repositories. However, there is a key difference between synced templates and repositories.

Repositories are meant for working on a repository. We introduce a workflow to create new branches and pull requests. Synced templates allow you to create a VM Sandbox/Sandbox template from a repository (or folder), and are meant to be used as a template for new projects (or for sharing as an example with others).

A good rule of thumb is that if you want to work on a repository, you should import a repository. If you want to create a template from a repository, you should create a synced template from a GitHub repository.

## Creating a synced template

A synced template runs code from a GitHub branch in CodeSandbox and keeps the changes synced with remote. A synced template can be either type of Sandbox. You can tell the difference by the way the URL is constructed:

- A synced template as a VM Sandbox will look something like this: `codesandbox.io/p/devbox/github`.
- A synced template as a Browser Sandbox will look something like this: `codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github`.

As explained below, you can create synced templates directly from the GitHub URL or through our GitHub importer tool.

### Directly from the GitHub URL

First, visit the GitHub repository or folder from which you want to create a synced template. The URL should look like `https://github.com/owner/repo` for a repository and `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/folder` for a folder.

Then, replace `github.com` with `githubbox.com` and press Enter.

This will redirect you to a URL that looks like `https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/github/owner/repo` or `https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/github/owner/repo/tree/main/folder`, which is the location of the newly created synced template!

### Using our GitHub importer

Go to our ["Repo Import" modal](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard?import_repo=true) and click on "Import template". Enter the GitHub URL you want to import in the input field and press "Open URL". This will redirect you to the location of the synced template.

### Using a Browser Extension

We have browser extensions for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-codesandbox/hdidglkcgdolpoijdckmafdnddjoglia)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/codesandbox/),
which add an 'Open in CodeSandbox' button to GitHub repo pages. This makes it
easy to import existing projects from GitHub into CodeSandbox.

## Configuring a title, icon & description

By default, we try to infer a synced template's name, description and icon based on the files in the repository. However, you can also configure this manually.

You can configure a title, description and template icon for your synced template in a file called `.codesandbox/template.json` in your synced template. This file is a JSON file that contains the following properties:

- `title`: The title of the template
- `description`: The description of the template
- `iconUrl`: The icon of the template. This should be a URL to a 64x64 PNG or JPEG image.
- `tags`: The tags that will be used for search results. This should be an array of strings.
- `published`: Whether the template is published. If this is set to `false`, the template will not be visible in the template search.

An example `template.json` could look like this:

```jsonc
// .codesandbox/template.json
{
  "title": "My Template",
  "description": "This is my template",
  "iconUrl": "https://example.com/icon.png",
  "tags": ["react", "typescript"],
  "published": true
}
```

All fields are optional—we will infer the missing fields from the repository contents.

After you've created this file and opened the synced template at least once, you can find it in the [template search](https://codesandbox.io/d) by searching for the title or description.

## VM behavior of synced templates

We try to automatically detect from your repository contents whether your project is more suited for a browser or VM Sandbox.

To force the template to load as a VM Sandbox, you can create a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your repository. This file should contain a valid [Dev Container configuration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/environment/devcontainers) that we'll use to build your VM Sandbox.

We use memory snapshotting to resume a VM quickly when someone visits it. To ensure that visitors of your VM Sandbox will always get the latest contents of your GitHub repository, we base the memory snapshot on the latest commit of your repository or folder.

This means that if you create a new commit in your repository, we will discard the memory snapshot of the synced template and will start the VM Sandbox from scratch on next visit. During the VM boot, we will download the latest file contents from the repository. This ensures that visitors to your VM Sandbox will always get the latest contents of your GitHub repository, but it also means that the first visit of your VM Sandbox after a commit can be slower than usual (only for memory; we do still keep the filesystem between invalidations).

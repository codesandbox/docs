# Clean Bootups

Normally a Sandbox resumes from hibernation. You can verify the type of bootup using `client.bootupType` or `sandbox.bootupType` when resuming an existing Sandbox.

But there are scenarios where we need to boot up the Sandbox from scratch. The most common scenario being when a Sandbox has been dormant for a week.

Whenever we boot a sandbox from scratch, we'll:

1. Start the Firecracker VM
2. Create a default user (called `pitcher-host`)
3. (optional) Build the Docker image specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
4. Start the Docker container
5. Mount the `/project/workspace` directory as a volume inside the Docker container

You will be able to connect to the Sandbox during this process and track its progress. You would normally want to do this through a UX so that your users are aware of this CLEAN bootup.

```ts
const client = await connectToSandbox({
  session,
  getSession: (id) => fetchJSON(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`)
})

if (client.bootupType === 'CLEAN') {
  const setupSteps = client.setup.getSteps()

  for (const step of setupSteps) {
    console.log(`Step: ${step.name}`);
    console.log(`Command: ${step.command}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${step.status}`);

    const output = await step.open()

    output.onOutput((output) => {
      console.log(output)
    })

    await step.waitUntilComplete()
  }
}
```

## Agent updates

Every Sandbox has an agent running on it. This agent is the what allows you to interact with the Sandbox environment.

When a new version of the agent is published, existing sandboxes will need to restart before they get new version.

You can check if the current sandbox is up to date using `isUpToDate()`

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

if (!sandbox.isUpToDate) {
    await sdk.sandboxes.restart(sandbox.id)
}
```

It is up to you to decide what the best user experience will be for your use case. At CodeSandbox we would show a notification when the agent was out of date and the user could choose when to update.

# Connecting

There are three different ways to connect to a Sandbox:

- **SDK**: When you want to connect to a Sandbox from your server where also the SDK is managed
- **Node**: When you want to connect to a Sandbox from a Node client environment, for example React Native
- **Browser**: When you want to connect to a Sandbox from a browser client environment

## SDK

On your server, where you use the SDK, you can connect directly to a Sandbox:

```ts
const sandbox = sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')
const client = await sandbox.connect()
```

## Node

So you might run a client in Node (ish) environment. For example React Native. To consume the Sandbox you need to request a session from your server (`sandbox.createSession`) and pass it to the client.

This is how your server can provide the session:

```ts
export const GET = async ({ params }) => {
  const sandbox = sdk.sandboxes.resume(params.sandboxId)
  const session = await sandbox.createSession()

  // Respond with the session
  return session
}
```

And in your client:

```ts
import { connectToSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk/node'

const getSession = () => fetchJson(`/api/sandboxes/my-sandbox-id`)

const client = await connectToSandbox({
  // Explicitly set initial session, which allows you to include it in your page load as well
  session: await getSession(),
  // On reconnect the session will be fetched from the server again
  getSession
})
```

## Browser

```ts
import { connectToSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk/browser';

const client = await connectToSandbox({
  session: initialSessionFromServer,
  // When reconnecting to the sandbox, fetch the session from the server
  getSession: (id) => fetchJson(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`)
});
```

This is how your server can provide the session:

```ts
export const GET = async ({ params }) => {
  const sandbox = sdk.sandboxes.resume(params.sandboxId)
  const session = await sandbox.createSession()

  // Respond with the session
  return session
}
```

The Browser session automatically manages the connection and will reconnect if the connection is lost. This is controlled by an option called `onFocusChange` and by default it will reconnect when the page is visible.

```ts
const client = await connectToSandbox({
  session: initialSessionFromServer,
  getSession: (id) => fetchJson(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`),
  onFocusChange: (notify) => {
    const onVisibilityChange = () => {
      notify(document.visibilityState === 'visible');
    }

    document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', onVisibilityChange);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', onVisibilityChange);
    }
  }
});
```

If you tell the browser session when it is in focus it will automatically reconnect when hibernated. Unless you explicitly disconnect the session.

While the `connectToSandbox` promise is resolving you can also listen to initialization events to show a loading state:

```ts
const client = await connectToSandbox({
  session: initialSessionFromServer,
  getSession: (id) => fetchJson(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`),
  onInitCb: (event) => {}
});
```

## Disconnecting the client

Disconnecting the client will end the session and automatically hibernate the sandbox after a timeout. You can also hibernate the sandbox explicitly from the server.

```ts
import { connectToSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk/browser'

const client = await connectToSandbox({
  session: initialSessionFromServer,
  getSession: (id) => fetchJson(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`),
})

// Disconnect returns a promise that resolves when the session is disconnected
client.disconnect();

// Optionally hibernate the sandbox explicitly by creating an endpoint on your server
fetch('/api/sandboxes/' + client.id + '/hibernate', {
  method: 'POST'
})

// You can reconnect explicitly by
client.reconnect()
```

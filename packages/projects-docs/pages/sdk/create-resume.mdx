# Create Sandbox

Sandboxes are the main building blocks of the CodeSandbox SDK. Each one represents a single project that you can run, fork, and modify.

Every Sandbox is backed by a Firecracker VM, and is completely isolated and persisted. Providing you with a secure environment to run untrusted code.

## Creating a Sandbox

To create a sandbox, call `sandbox.create()`:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
```

<Callout>
By default Sandboxes are `public` and can be accessed and forked by anyone with a url on CodeSandbox. Available privacy options are `private`, `public-hosts`, or `public`. Private sandboxes require host tokens to access exposed ports.
</Callout>

If no `id` option is provided to `sandbox.create()`, we'll create a sandbox forked from our [Universal](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/universal-pcz35m) template on CodeSandbox. You can also pass in a specific template id from [our collection of templates](/sdk/snapshot-library) or by creating your own template using our [Template Builder](/sdk/templates).

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    id: 'some-sandbox-id',

    // Optional properties
    title: 'my-sandbox',
    description: 'My sandbox',
    tags: ['my-tag'],

    // Privacy options: 'private', 'public-hosts', or 'public'
    privacy: 'private',

    // Collection folder on Dashboard
    path: '/users/some-user-folder',

    // Prefer closest cluster. Follows ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.
    ipcountry: "US",

    // What VM Tier to use for the Sandbox
    vmTier: VMTier.Pico,

    // How quickly the sandbox should hibernate after inactivity.
    // Defaults to 300 seconds for free users, 1800 seconds for
    // pro users. Maximum is 86400 seconds (1 day).
    hibernationTimeoutSeconds: 120_000,

    // Configure if Sandbox should wake up automatically on HTTP
    // or requests or WebSocket connections
    automaticWakeupConfig: {
        http: true,
        websocket: true
    }
})
```

<Callout>
The `automaticWakeupConfig` only wakes up the Sandbox, it does not extend its hibernation timeout.
</Callout>

## Get an Existing Sandbox

To get information about an existing sandbox without resuming it, use `sdk.sandboxes.get(id)`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.get('sandbox-id');
```

This method retrieves sandbox metadata and status without waking up a hibernated sandbox.

## List Running Sandboxes

To get a list of all currently running sandboxes, use `sdk.sandboxes.listRunning()`:

```ts
const runningSandboxes = await sdk.sandboxes.listRunning();
console.log(runningSandboxes); // Array of sandbox objects
```

This method returns an array of sandbox objects that are currently active and running.

## Resume an Existing Sandbox

To resume an existing sandbox from hibernation and connect to it call: `sdk.sandboxes.resume(id)`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id');
```

<Callout>
Sandboxes that have been dormant for a week will do a CLEAN bootup, meaning it will run its setup tasks when resumed. Please make sure you [handle this](/sdk/lifecycle#managing-clean-bootups) case in your application.
</Callout>

## Sandbox Properties

The `sandbox` object represents the instance of a sandbox running in our infrastructure. The methods detailed below require the Sandbox to be running.

Each Sandbox has the following properties, with information about it's own instance:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the sandbox.
- `isUpToDate`: Whether the sandbox is up to date with the latest agent version.
- `cluster`: The cluster the sandbox is running on.
- `bootupType`: The type of bootup, `RUNNING`, `CLEAN`, `RESUME` or `FORK`.

## Snapshots

When a Sandbox is hibernated, we create and save a snapshot of the underlying Firecracker VM.

If you call `sdk.sandboxes.resume(id)` or a network request is made to the Sandbox, we restore the snapshot. Allowing you to continue from exactly where you left off.

As we already have a snapshot, we can also use it to create a fork of your project in a new Sandbox. So you can create multiple instances without having to do all the set up work every time.

```ts
import { CodeSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'
const sdk = new CodeSandbox();

const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
const client = await sandbox.connect()

// Run anything on the sandbox
await client.shells.run('echo test > test.txt');

const sandbox2 = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    id: sandbox.id
});

// Now we have two sandboxes that have the same fs & memory state!
```

You can use this to add support for checkpoint/restore functionality, or A/B test different agent iterations. At CodeSandbox we use this to enable users to quickly fork shared Sandboxes to their own account.

### Manually Creating a Snapshot

```ts
import { CodeSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();

// Do work

await sdk.sandboxes.hibernate(sandbox.id);
```

Creating a snapshot can take between 3-10 seconds. Resuming from a snapshot takes between 0.5-2 seconds.

## Live snapshots

If a Sandbox is already running we can still fork its exact current state. This has a small overhead of about 0.5 seconds.

# Environment

Sandboxes on CodeSandbox are backed by a [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVM, within the VM we run a rootless Docker container based on a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration (specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file).

## Booting a Sandbox

Whenever we boot a sandbox from scratch, we'll:

1. Start the Firecracker VM
2. Create a default user (called `pitcher-host`)
3. (optional) Build the Docker image specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
4. Start the Docker container
5. Mount the `/project/sandbox` directory as a volume inside the Docker container

We run an agent inside the VM that the SDK connects to. Via an RPC protocol you can then interact with the sandbox.

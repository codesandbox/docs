# Hosts

Hosts are the services exposed by your Sandbox. They all have their own hostname which includes the port. The `sandbox.hosts` API will allow you to access these your Sandbox hosts securily using signed urls, headers or cookies.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const hostToken = await sandbox.hosts.createToken()
const session = await sandbox.connect({
  id: 'some-user-reference',
  hostToken
})

// Will give you a URL to access the service on port 5173 with a signed token
const url = session.hosts.getUrl(5173)

// If you rather want to access passing headers
const headers = session.hosts.getHeaders()

console.log(url)
```

By default all Sandboxes are private and you should be using host tokens. With public or unlisted Sandboxes the host tokens are not necessary, but you can still `getUrl` to generate a url for the relevant port.

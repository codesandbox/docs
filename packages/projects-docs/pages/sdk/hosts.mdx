# Hosts

Hosts are the services exposed by your Sandbox. They all have their own hostname which includes the port. The `client.hosts` API will allow you to access your Sandbox hosts securely using signed urls, headers or cookies.

The `hostToken` is embedded in your session.

```ts
// Will give you a URL to access the service on port 5173 with a signed token
const url = client.hosts.getUrl(5173)

// If you rather want to access passing headers
const headers = client.hosts.getHeaders()

console.log(url)
```

<Callout>
By default all Sandboxes are public, but you need to use host tokens to access private Sandboxes. With public or public-hosts Sandboxes the host tokens are not necessary, but you can still `getUrl` to generate a url for the relevant port.

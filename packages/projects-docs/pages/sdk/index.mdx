CodeSandbox SDK enables you to quickly create and run isolated sandboxes securely.
The SDK can be used to run concurrent VMs to support multiple use cases such as browser editors, AI agents, code interpretation and [more](/sdk/use-cases.mdx)

## Getting Started

1. Create or log into your [CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin)

2. Next create an API key at [https://codesandbox.io/t/api](https://codesandbox.io/t/api), and enable all scopes.

3. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @codesandbox/sdk
```

Your first interaction:

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox(process.env.CSB_API_KEY);
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
const client = await sandbox.connect();

const output = await client.commands.run("echo 'Hello World'");

console.log(output) // Hello World
```

### OpenTelemetry Support

You can pass an OpenTelemetry tracer to the CodeSandbox constructor to enable tracing for all SDK operations:

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";
import { trace } from "@opentelemetry/api";

const tracer = trace.getTracer('my-app');
const sdk = new CodeSandbox(process.env.CSB_API_KEY, {
  tracer
});
```

This will automatically trace all Sandboxes, Sandbox, and SandboxClient methods, including modules.

## How it works

The SDK can spin up a sandbox by cloning a template in under 3 seconds. Inside this VM you have a full development environment.

Under the hood, the SDK uses CodeSandbox's microVM infrastructure to spin up sandboxes. The environment supports:

1. Resume/clone VMs in under 1 second
2. VM FS persistence (with `git` version control)
3. Environment customization using Docker & Docker Compose (Dev Containers)

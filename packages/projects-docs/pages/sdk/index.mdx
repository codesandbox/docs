CodeSandbox SDK provides an API you can use to quickly create and run isolated development environments quickly and securely to run untrusted code.

Under the hood, the SDK uses the microVM infrastructure of CodeSandbox to spin up sandboxes. It supports:

- Starting fresh VMs within 4 seconds
- Snapshotting/restoring VMs (checkpointing) at any point in time
  - With snapshot restore times of less than 2 seconds
- Cloning VMs within 3 seconds
- Source control (git, GitHub, CodeSandbox SCM)
- Running any Dockerfile

## In a nutshell

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

// Create an isolated environment
const sdk = new CodeSandbox(token);
const sandbox = await sdk.createSandbox();

// Run any server script
await sandbox.shells.python.run("print(1+1)");

// End the session (resume it whenever you want)
await sandbox.hibernate();
```

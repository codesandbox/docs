# Preview API Access

If you are using the [Browser Preview API](./browser-previews), you will need to set up your allowed preview hosts. These are the hosts where you will be mounting the iframe, for example `localhost:5173` or `company-domain.com`. Configuring these hosts using the SDK CLI. The hosts are stored on your workspace and applies to all your Sandboxes.

```bash
$ csb preview-hosts --list

$ csb preview-hosts --add :host

$ csb preview-hosts --remove :host

$ csb preview-hosts --clear
```

The `:host` is a JavaScript RegEx. So you can set your host as: `my-project-.*-.*.vercel.app` for example.

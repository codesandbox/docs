# VM Specs

Whenever you start a sandbox, you can specify which VM specs to use. This allows you to customize the VM to your needs. We also allow you to change the VM specs of a running sandbox on the fly,
without reboot. This is useful if you want to scale up or down your sandbox dynamically based on workload needs.

## Starting Sandbox with Specs

You can start a sandbox with a specific VM tier by passing the `vmTier` option to the `sandbox.create` method:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox, VMTier } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create({ vmTier: VMTier.Small });
```

You can also approximate the VM size:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create({
  vmTier: VMTier.fromSpecs({ cpu: 4, memGiB: 8 }),
});
```

This will pick the smallest VM tier that can fit the specs you provided.

## Changing VM Specs

You can change the VM specs of a running sandbox by calling the `sandbox.updateTier` method:

```ts
await sandbox.updateTier(VMTier.Medium);
```

This will change the VM specs of the sandbox dynamically, without rebooting.

  Be careful when scaling the VM specs of a running sandbox down. If you scale down the VM too much, it might not have enough resources to run your tasks and will slow to a crawl.

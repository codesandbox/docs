# VM Specs

Whenever you start a sandbox, you can specify which VM specs to use. This allows you to customize the VM to your needs. Currently, we support the following VM specs:

| VM size | Credits / hour | Cost / hour | CPU      | RAM    |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Pico    | 7 credits      | $0.126      | 2 cores  | 1 GB   |
| Nano    | 10 credits     | $0.18       | 2 cores  | 4 GB   |
| Micro   | 20 credits     | $0.36       | 4 cores  | 8 GB   |
| Small   | 40 credits     | $0.72       | 8 cores  | 16 GB  |
| Medium  | 80 credits     | $1.44       | 16 cores | 32 GB  |
| Large   | 160 credits    | $2.88       | 32 cores | 64 GB  |
| XLarge  | 320 credits    | $5.76       | 64 cores | 128 GB |

We also allow you to change the VM specs of a running sandbox on the fly, without reboot. This is useful if you want to scale up or down your sandbox dynamically based on workload needs.

## Starting Sandbox with Specs

You can start a sandbox with a specific VM size by passing the `vmSize` option to the `sandbox.create` method:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox, VMTier } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create({ vmTier: VMTier.Small });
```

You can also approximate the VM size:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create({
  vmTier: VMTier.fromSpecs({ cpu: 4, memGiB: 8 }),
});
```

This will pick the smallest VM size that can fit the specs you provided.

## Changing VM Specs

You can change the VM specs of a running sandbox by calling the `sandbox.updateTier` method:

```ts
await sandbox.updateTier(VMTier.Medium);
```

This will change the VM specs of the sandbox dynamically, without rebooting.

  Be careful when scaling the VM specs of a running sandbox down. If you scale down the VM too much, it might not have enough resources to run your tasks and will slow to a crawl.

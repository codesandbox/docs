# Use Cases

These are some example use cases that you could use this library for:

- **Code interpretation:** Run code in a sandbox to interpret it. This way, you can run untrusted code without worrying about it affecting your system.

- **Development environments:** Create a sandbox for each developer, and run their code in the sandbox. This way, you can run multiple development environments in parallel without them interfering with each other.

- **AI Agents:** Create a sandbox for each AI agent, and run the agent in the sandbox. This way, you can run multiple agents in parallel without them interfering with each other. Using the forking mechanism, you can also A/B test different agents.

- **CI/CD:** Run tests inside a sandbox, and hibernate the sandbox when the tests are done. This way, you can quickly start the sandbox again when you need to run the tests again or evaluate the results.

# Use Cases

Overall, CodeSandbox SDK is a good fit with any project that requires any of the following:

- Running multiple development environments at scale.
- Acess to an isolated code interpreter.
- Access to a sandboxed environment.

There are hundreds of use cases that can benefit from these three features. Below are some of the most interesting ones we've come across recently.

## Code interpretation

Because CodeSandbox SDK allows programmatically spinning up sandboxes (VMs) to execute code in, it provides an ideal environment to interpret code, both for simple and complex tasks.

Because these sandboxes exist in total isolation, you can run untrusted code without worrying about it affecting your system.

Many of the CodeSandbox SDK early adopters, such as Blackbox AI, are leveraging this to bring code interpretation capabilities to their generative AI applications. We highly recommend following the [guide by Together AI](https://docs.together.ai/docs/code-execution) to get CodeSandbox SDK running seamlessly with any of the leading open-source LLMs.

## AI Agents

Agentic workflows are a fast-emerging use case that can benefit immensely from CodeSandbox SDK.

You can give each agents a sandbox to resolve user prompts, or create autonomous agents running on sandboxes. This ensures they are securely isolated from your system but still can interact with each other as required.

You can run multiple agents in parallel without them interfering with each other. Using the forking mechanism, you can also A/B test different agents.

## Development environments

With the SDK, you can programmatically provision a sandbox for anyone who needs an environment to code in. This way, you can run multiple development environments in parallel without them interfering with each other.

With this, you can essentially create your own CodeSandbox for your team/company/school!

## CI/CD

CodeSandbox SDK is a worthy successor to CodeSandbox CI.

With the SDK, you can set up your own CI/CD implementation to run tests inside a sandbox and hibernate the sandbox when the tests are done. This way, you can quickly start the sandbox again when you need to run the tests again or evaluate the results.

You can also use the SDK to create 1 sandbox that runs your CI/CD preparation, and then clone it multiple times to run your tests in parallel.

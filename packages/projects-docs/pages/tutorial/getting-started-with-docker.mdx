# Getting started with Docker

Docker is available for Devboxes and Repositories. With Docker, you can get `root` access and install any package to use within CodeSandbox, including databases and new languages.

[Here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/docker-example-hsd8ke) you can find a sandbox that uses Docker.

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

To get started with Docker, you need to create a new file called `devcontainer.json` inside the `.devcontainer` folder. As an example, you could put these contents in:

```json filename=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json"
{
    "build": { "dockerfile": "Dockerfile" },
}
```

And then create a `Dockerfile` in the same `devcontainer` folder:

```docker filename=".devcontainer/Dockerfile"
FROM ubuntu

# Install htop by default
RUN apt update -y && apt install -y htop
```

<Callout>
This Dockerfile is intended for development, not for deployment. This means that you probably don't need to `COPY` or `ADD`. We handle that for you by mounting the project directory at `/workspace` in the container.
</Callout>

<Callout>
At this time, CodeSandbox currently only supports Debian and Ubuntu based images, for the best compatibility and user experience.

### 2. Rebuild the container

Now that you've created a Dockerfile and saved it, you should see a notification pop up, asking you to rebuild the container. Whenever the Dockerfile changes, we need to rebuild the container from that Dockerfile.

You can press "Yes", and it will build the container for you. Alternatively you can also rebuild the container by opening the command palette (<kbd>CMD/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>), and searching for "Rebuild Container".

With a Dockerfile in `.devcontainer`, the VM will also always make sure to create the container when it boots.

### 3. Use the container

Now that the container has been built, all your new terminal sessions will be executed from inside this container. You can test this by opening a new terminal, and verifying that `htop` is installed (from our example).

Note that you also have `root` access inside the terminal, that's because we give root access by default inside a container. With this, you can install new packages and use them in your sandbox from the terminal as well. Keep in mind that it's still better to configure this in the `Dockerfile` in the long term, as these temporary container changes won't persist between Dockerfile rebuilds.

### 4. Create Docker Compose file
Once the environment is set up with `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, you can run additional services that are required for the dev environment using the native docker compose integration in CodeSandbox.

Create a new file `docker-compose.yml` in the `.devcontainer` folder. For example, you can add the following contents in the file to run an nginx server. Note that you need to add your development container (from `Dockerfile`) as well. 

``` yaml filename=".devcontainer/docker-compose.yml"
services:
    app:
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        command: sleep infinity
    nginx:
        image: nginx
        ports:
            - 8080:80
```

To use this configuration, you should change your devcontainer configuration, like so:

```json filename=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json"
{
	"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
    "service": "app",
}
```

Note the `service` field. This tells devcontainers to start the services in `docker-compose.yml`, and then attach to the `app` service.

### 5. Run docker compose.
Now that you've created the `docker-compose.yml` and saved it, you should see a notification pop up, asking you to restart the `docker compose` command. Whenever the `docker-compose.yml` changes, this prompt will be shown and you can restart docker compose.

![Notification for starting docker compose](/docker-compose-notification.png)

You can press "Yes" and it will run `docker compose up` for you. You should now see a DevTool open with Docker Compose logs. Once the `nginx` image is pulled and run, port `8080` should open and a notification should show with the URL to access the port.

# Install system packages

For many modules or tools probably you'd like to install some packages. Unfortunately, due to security reasons in Projects you canâ€™t run commands using sudo but you can use Nix as a drop in replacement. You can read about this more on the [workspace limitations page](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/setting-up/limitations). 
Actually, most of the packages are available in [Nix](https://nixos.org/) as well so what you have to do is replace the `sudo apt-get install` or `sudo apt install` to `nix-env -i`, and that's all. You can check out the available packages in Nix on [https://search.nixos.org/packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages).


For example, you can install Google Chrome as you see below:

On Debian you can run: `sudo apt install chromium`

Inside CodeSandbox Projects just run `nix-env -i chromium`

Tip: Don't forget to add this command as a [setup task](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/setting-up/tasks) so you don't have to run this command on every newly created branch, Projects will make it available for you immediately!
</Callout>

As an alternative apporach to install packages, you can define a file in the root of your project called `csb.nix` and configure which packages should be automatically installed from the [nix package store](https://search.nixos.org/packages). In order to use this configuration on every branch you have to commit this file back to your main branch.

An example configuration is this:

```nix
with import <nixpkgs> {};

stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = "csb";
    buildInputs = [
        chromium
        postgres
    ];
    shellHook = ''
        export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin/:$PATH"
    '';
}
```

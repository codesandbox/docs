# Install system packages

When using some modules or tools, you may want to install some packages. Unfortunately, due to security reasons, you can't run commands using `sudo` in CodeSandbox Repositories - but you can use Nix as a drop-in replacement. You can read about this more on the [workspace limitations page](../../learn/setting-up/limitations).

Fortunately, [Nix](https://nixos.org/) provides most of the packages that you will likely need. You just have to replace the commands for `sudo apt-get install` or `sudo apt install` with `nix-env -i` - that's all. You can check out the available packages in Nix on [https://search.nixos.org/packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages).

For example, to install Google Chrome on Debian, you would use `sudo apt install chromium`. In CodeSandbox Repositories, just run `nix-env -i chromium` and you will get the same result.

Tip: Don't forget to add this command as a [setup task](../../learn/setting-up/tasks) so that you don't have to run this command on every newly created branch. CodeSandbox Repositories will make it available for you immediately!

As an alternative approach to installing packages, you can define a file in the root of your project called `csb.nix` and configure which packages should be automatically installed from the [Nix package store](https://search.nixos.org/packages). To use this configuration on every branch, you have to commit this file back to your main branch.

See an example configuration below:

```nix
with import <nixpkgs> {};

stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = "csb";
    buildInputs = [
        chromium
        postgres
    ];
    shellHook = ''
        export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin/:$PATH"
    '';
}
```
